        'about': "Spectre 001 is a podcast started, kinda sorta, in 2018 after its cast started playing a weekly game of Dungeons and Dragons together. Fast-forard a few years and that same group of guys decided to try a new system and just kinda record themselves doing it. Every week, Pat, Garrett, Tom, and Shane dig a little deeper into a universe envisioned by Joe in a massive, sprawling space opera.  Or... some shit like that."

        'about': "I love and respect Joe as a long term friend but god dammit we were supposed to write bios for this and Joe didn't and so as the guy who fills in the website I gotta say this dude is big fucking lame. Lives in the most weird ass semi-rural backwards ass motorcycle town in fucking egypt purely of his own goddamn free will and is consequently very far from the rest of us. For that this dude is a mad BITCH. Jabroni."

        'about': "So like generally speaking, Pat is a cool guy and shit. But he didn't write a bio, and so for retribution I'm just gonna take an opportunity to shit on him. He fucking SUCKS. Non bio-writing little BITCH. Still in college-ass fucking young guy who didn't have the good sense to just simply be a few years older. Probably has more bush than dick. Jabroni."

        "about": "I am a big fan of Garrett, but this guy ALSO didn't write a fucking bio despite being the guy who wanted bios from all of us in the first place. What a fucking CHUMP. Man went directly from living with his parents as a young weenie college grad to buying a house and immediately becoming an old ass man tryna fix drywall and shit. Jabroni."

        'about': "Big love for Tom for the most part, but as the next guy who didn't write a goddamn bio... what a bitch. You know that feeling when you go for a run but it's pretty cold out and after you're done and trying to pee your dong is like shrunk and weirdly dense, like in an alien kinda way that you've never experienced before? This man's entire personality. Jabroni"

        'about': "Shane Thiede started off his experience playing RPGs in 2018 when, on a whim, Joe decided to pull a remote D&D group together. He's been playing with those same guys (everyone who's in this goddamn podcast) every week ever since. In his free time, Shane is an up-and-coming Detroit musician, a web developer, and a gigantic, insufferable coffee snob. He is generally unsure of what else to write in this section."
